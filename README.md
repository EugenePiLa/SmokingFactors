Welcome to my portfolio project.

The goals chosen for this project are to analyze the different correlations to being a smoker or a non-smoker, based on the dataset provided by Codecademy. Thereby, the results will show if different factors are more or less related to smoking, like sex, age, having children and which region we're living in.

This analysis is limited in such that it is calculating correlation and not causation, and even if it was able to do the latter, it would still not be able to analyze whether the factor is an affect or an effect to smoking.

In this project, I will import data from a CSV file and analyze it using Python.
