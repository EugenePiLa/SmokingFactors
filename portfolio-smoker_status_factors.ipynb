    "In conclusion, this project found that though the age and being a parent do not seem to have a correlation with the smoker status, it also found that the sex and the region where we live seem to be related to the smoker status. Indeed, most smokers are males. Furthermore, people living in the West of the U.S are less likely to smoke than the people living in the East. Since our sample is limited, we can't take those information for granted, but it definitely lets us ponder on what further analysis would discover. "
